Javascript challenge Bootcamp

# This is a great challenge, I try to do my best but in this case I think  is neccesary more time to do all I want it or perform the site. I put in practice a lot of class exercises and I enjoy it.
### The first part consist in a html file and 2 js files, Using d3 I upload to avar all the data of one javascript file, then with a date in html vinculate to the ottÂ¡her javascript file (app.js) go to the search in all the data and change the original table that was create at the beginning. I modified the html to insert a button to do a new search and clear the last search, well thats the idea but It could be better.
### The second folder contains the same files but for the html the changes was to insert more inputs to do more filters in the data, in this part I try to do the select with each array of data but it was no possible insert the data in the new options of a html select so I let the inputs, even of that the search works.
